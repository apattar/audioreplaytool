How to allow user to implement start and end markers?
- buttons on each marker that say "start" and "end"
- drag & drop ends of snippet bracket. This could work pretty well actually, have obviously movable item at ends. cool animations when snapping back oooh
up until you decide, you can just directly call the functions from the console

Visual elements to add (draw it out, then implement):
- visualization and relative position of buttons (decide on button groupings)
- recording visual indicator
- looping visual indicator
- choosable brackets indicating snippets - maybe better way to do it is to indicate start & end markers, so make those clickable, and the bracket shows up based on those markers
- when there's an active snippet, on the bottom half of the screen there's a visualization specific to that snippet of higher resolution! Below that can be snippet-related controls, like naming, saving, etc.
